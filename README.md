# Python-Translator
This is a small command line based application that I have written in Python. I hope you find some use for it.

What it does:
It fetches words from an SQL database, and prompts the user to enter a word. It will then provide all definitions of the word. If a word is spelled incorrectly, it will look for a similar word in the database and ask the user if they meant that, and allow them to define that word instead.
